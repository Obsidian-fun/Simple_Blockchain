A simple blockchain , for me to understand what's going on over here..

Navigating through the code:
- In func main(), NewBlockChain() function is called, which returns the Genesis Block, the first block in the chain.
-	The Genesis Block returns a block with isGenesis set to True, identifying itself as the first block.
- On typing curl -X GET 127.0.0.1/new, we invoke the newBook function.
